# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Project-Collab is a platform for UofT students to post and discover new software projects. The platform highlights projects from peers and encourages the participation of new contributors. Students with ideas looking for contributors can post their ideas, allowing them to be discoverable by fellow students. Projects are searchable to all users and are suggested to users who share similar interests to the project.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

There are 2 groups of users who we are targeting for our application:

  Project Posters:
  - Experienced student planning to build large projects and are looking for students.
  - Passionate individuals looking to explore an area of expertise through building a project.
  - Professors looking for students to help with research projects
  - University, non-profits organizations looking for students to work on projects

  Project Searchers:
  - Inexperienced students at UofT who are interested in collaborating on software projects, gaining hands-on experience outside of class, and looking for a platform to learn, discover and demonstrate these skills to employers. A typical users from this group could be a 1st year Computer Science student, looking to expand their skills to land an internship after the summer.
  - Experienced students looking to learn new technologies through projects that focuses on their technology of interest.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Currently, UofT students are resorting to individual projects, finding projects from personal connections, online resources. However, since students come to UofT with different backgrounds, it is often difficult to find peers who have similar skills to work with. Project-collab provides these students with the platform to connect with each other, along with resource to get students started working with new technology or projects they are interested in.

On a recent community survey conducted, we asked the community of computer science students, how the CSSU/CS department/CS community to support them in aspects of career and side projects. The results were quite reassuring: 12/49 responses wanted support for project related work, through a platform to share and discover personal projects. The community seems to have validated the project for us, bringing up the need for the platform we have envisioned.

### Highlights

The first two team meetings focused on defining the project idea, which is a student focused platform aimed at encouraging collaboration. We then defined the process of community building to be enabling students to share project ideas and support each other on the pursuit to learn new technology and skills. Aiming at putting any student in an inclusive environment that would allow anyone to begin their first step towards their careers regardless of their currently level of skills or expertise.

There are several determining factors that has driven us to this decision:
The percentage of students that does not work on side projects (54%)
The percentage of students we desire a platform to share and view projects (24%)
The percentage of students who prefer working on side projects with others than themselves (50%)

We also thought about the recruiting aspect of the platform in which we would have recruiter join the platform as a way for them to evaluate users through the actual projects they work on, but through a long discuss we thought to focus on getting students on board.

We also thought about how we could maybe tackle another issue that many cs students face when working on side-projects in group. These issues pertain to things like following a design process and writing good and maintainable code. We thought that we could make students that use our platform try to incorporate a certain design process into their projects but found that due to the various number of different tools out there and preferences It would be better to stay out of the actual development cycle of students and mabe create a section of our sites that lists helpful tools and reading material that would help students writing good and maintainable code.
