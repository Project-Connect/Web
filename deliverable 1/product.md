# Project Collab

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Project-Collab is a platform for UofT students to post and discover new software projects. The platform highlights projects from peers and encourages the participation of new contributors. Students with ideas looking for contributors can post their ideas, allowing them to be discoverable by fellow students. Projects are searchable to all users and are suggested to users who share similar interests to the project.

A mockups is currently available via the link below:

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

The target users are University of Toronto students or faculty who are interested in working on a software project. Within this group of users, they must share at least one of the two motivations for working on a software project:
 
  Seeking contributors for a project:
  - Students or faculty with a project idea seeking contributors to work on the project.
  - Professors looking for students to help with research projects.
  - University, non-profits organizations looking for students to work on projects

  Searching for a project:
  - Students who are interested in collaborating on software projects, gaining hands-on experience outside of class, and looking for a platform to learn, discover and demonstrate these skills to employers. An example would be a 1st year Computer Science student, looking to expand their skills to land an internship after the summer.
  
#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Currently, UofT students are resorting to individual projects, finding projects from personal connections or online resources. However, since students have a variety of technical experience, it is often difficult to find peers who have similar skills to work with or find a willing mentor to learn from. Project-collab provides these students with the platform to connect with each other, along with resource to get students started working with new technology or projects they are interested in.

On a recent community survey conducted, we asked the community of computer science students, how the CSSU/CS department/CS community to support them in aspects of career and side projects. The results were quite reassuring: 12/49 responses wanted support for project related work, through a platform to share and discover personal projects. The community seems to have validated the project for us, bringing up the need for the platform we have envisioned.

### Highlights

The first two team meetings focused on defining the project idea, which is a student focused platform aimed at encouraging collaboration. We then defined the process of community building to be enabling students to share project ideas and support each other on the pursuit to learn new technology and skills. Aiming at putting any student in an inclusive environment that would allow anyone to begin their first step towards their careers regardless of their currently level of skills or expertise.

There are several determining factors that has driven us to this decision:
The percentage of students that does not work on side projects (54%)
The percentage of students we desire a platform to share and view projects (24%)
The percentage of students who prefer working on side projects with others than themselves (50%)

We also thought about the recruiting aspect of the platform in which we would have recruiter join the platform as a way for recruiters to evaluate students through the projects contributions. However, we have decided this feature would be out of scope for our project.

We also thought about how we could maybe tackle another issue that many cs students face when working on side-projects in group. These issues pertain to things like following a design process and writing good and maintainable code. We thought that we could make students that use our platform try to incorporate a certain design process into their projects but found that due to the various number of different tools out there and preferences it would be better to stay out of the actual development cycle of students and create a section of our sites that lists helpful tools and reading material that would help students write good and maintainable code.

Lastly, we also did a bit of external search on our product in terms of seeing if other products like ours existed. One similar product we found we could compare and contrast our idea with was Intel’s Developer Mesh site (https://devmesh.intel.com/projects). The Developer Mesh site is a webpage that aims to be “join student developers for AI” by helping then find collaborator for their AI, ML and deep learning projects. When we compared our idea to the intel site we found since we where doing something similar to intel where we selected a certain subset of developers to target. In our case we selected UofT developers where as intel selected AI developers. We feel that in a way being less restrictive in terms of the type of project that are on our site, we can better target a wider audience. Although we do have some overlap with the intel site we feel that there are certain features on our site (i.e. our filtering and matching systems), that will make us unique in our own way and potential a better product.
