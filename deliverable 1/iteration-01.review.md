# Project Collab

## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 9th 2018
 * Where: BA3200

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 - Using Slack as a form of communication
 - Weekly meeting agenda on google drive
 - Had 1 group member facilitating the discussion from weekly agenda

Slack is presented as a very formal form of communication, which eliminates distractions compared to other communication chanel such as facebook.

Weekly meeting agendas are great to think of high level discussion that the team is having during every meeting, there's a guide towards productive discussion, as well as a backlog that allows the team to look back and review previous meetings.

Having a discussion facilitator, although not exactly yet the scrum master since no explicit task has been given out to each individual, has be very successful as a form of productive discussion. The facilitator is able to postpone discussions that are on a tangent or off track from the originally planned discussion.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Having work assigned as "group effort".
- Having discussions that are too vague.

The by-stander effect has taken it's toll in this case, assigning work that is based on the group's merit has little effect of getting work done than assigning specific task. It is important for the product owner to have discussions that aims to break-down task than to purely discuss about tasks. Having more specific goals attribute much more to moving towards a goal.


#### Planned changes

Group discussion will not only reply on the facilitator/ scrum master, but will also involve 2 other members to be actively taking notes.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 - Updated mockup to demonstrate the sign in, sign up, and Github login process.
 - Defined the core functionalities that is required for the MVP
 - We also came up with a list of practice task for the team to warmup on the tools used for the project.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 - We did not finish the set of user stories we had in mind, this was due to the lack of effort put into the user stories and not recognizing user stories was a priority currently.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
  - Breakdown the core functionalities so that we see into smaller components to be worked on.
  - Finish the user stories to further the flow of users using the product.
