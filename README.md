Project-Collab is a platform for UofT students to post and discover new software projects. The platform highlights projects from peers and encourages the participation of new contributors. Students with ideas looking for contributors can post their ideas, allowing them to be discoverable by fellow students. Projects are searchable to all users and are suggested to users who share similar interests to the project.

The target users are University of Toronto students or faculty who are interested in working on a software project. Within this group of users, they must share at least one of the two motivations for working on a software project:
 
  Seeking contributors for a project:
  - Students or faculty with a project idea seeking contributors to work on the project.
  - Professors looking for students to help with research projects.
  - University, non-profits organizations looking for students to work on projects

  Searching for a project:
  - Students who are interested in collaborating on software projects, gaining hands-on experience outside of class, and looking for a platform to learn, discover and demonstrate these skills to employers. An example would be a 1st year Computer Science student, looking to expand their skills to land an internship after the summer.
  
  Currently, UofT students are resorting to individual projects, finding projects from personal connections or online resources. However, since students have a variety of technical experience, it is often difficult to find peers who have similar skills to work with or find a willing mentor to learn from. Project-collab provides these students with the platform to connect with each other, along with resource to get students started working with new technology or projects they are interested in.

On a recent community survey conducted, we asked the community of computer science students, how the CSSU/CS department/CS community to support them in aspects of career and side projects. The results were quite reassuring: 12/49 responses wanted support for project related work, through a platform to share and discover personal projects. The community seems to have validated the project for us, bringing up the need for the platform we have envisioned.
