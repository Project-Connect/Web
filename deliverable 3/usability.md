# Usability Study

### Goal of Study

Allow first set of test users to use the appplication under monitored conditions to gather data to suggest new features and improvements. These users do not need to have a technical background. However, if they do, it is an added benefit.

### Goal of Project

The goal of the project is for companies to post project ideas and students can volunteer for the posted projects.
The main idea is to replace the project sign up through Google Drive which CSC301 uses to post project suggestions by
companies. 

In order to verify the project proposals and protect students from potential misuse, an instructor must be present of 
oversee the submitted projects.

* The blue used for the mini project view is harsh and makes it hard to look at
