### Usability Study

### Goal of Project

The goal of the project is for companies to post project ideas and students can volunteer for the posted projects.
The main idea is to replace the project sign up through Google Drive which CSC301 uses to post project suggestions by
companies. 

In order to verify the project proposals and protect students from potential misuse, an instructor must be present of 
oversee the submitted projects.
