# Roughly follows this format:
#### Introduction (30-45 seconds)
* *Give the audience some context. Tell the audience what they are about to watch*
* Similar to last time, but now we are doing prof user story 
* Scene: In a lecture room, have our website on the projector and a professor who will pretend it is the start of that year's CSC301 class
* Script: "Hello class, welcome to the second lecture of CSC301. Today we will begin your D1 project planning phase. During this week, your team will go to this website and apply to one of the approved projects from the non-profit organizations we have found for you. Each project has been vetted and approved by David and you can apply to whichever project you are most interested in."

#### Demo (1½ - 2 minutes)
Demonstrate your product. Present it from the user’s perspective, and guide the audience through the most common user flow (for example, watch the demo on this website).

##### Organization view

### Usability Study

### Goal of Project

The goal of the project is for companies to post project ideas and students can volunteer for the posted projects.
The main idea is to replace the project sign up through Google Drive which CSC301 uses to post project suggestions by
companies. 

In order to verify the project proposals and protect students from potential misuse, an instructor must be present of 
oversee the submitted projects.
