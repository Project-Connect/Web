## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 30th
 * Where: BA3200

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

Overall this deliverable went very well, apart from everyone having insanely busy and different schedules there is really not much that we'd change in retrospect.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
    - Splitting into front-end and back-end teams helped in a few key ways:
        - Given the difficulty of scheduling this allowed for more in person meetings with entire teams and allowed us to have different group chats for each team for better communication. 
        - This also allowed work to be broken down much more easily as it was only 3 or 4 people working together not trying to coordinate 7 people.
    - GitHub Usage
        - Our team certainly benefited from the branch protection and Travis testing before pull requests that we set up which avoided a some useless and buggy code from being added to the repository and made for less issues since each team looked over their teammates code before it was committed. 
        - We tagged all of our commits with issues and it made it easy to see exactly why different things were added and checking that they satisfied the given specifications. 
        - ticketing system??

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
    - Social coding experiment 
        - we learned drinking whiskey during meetings does not contribute to effective work
    - Even with the ticket system which worked well for the most part, we had two people do the same component. Perhaps we could have put more emphasis in the meetings on making sure to use the ticket system
    - Using Slack to communicate turned out to be an awful idea as people kept missing notifications, we ended up switching to three Facebook group chats, a general chat with the whole team and separate chats for the front-end and back-end teams.
    
#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?
   
   - Continuous integration setup with basic tests
        - Setting up tests was difficult to do as we did not have specific enough plans on what was being built before and then after we decided it did not make sense to add them in at the end of D2 since by then they would not be as useful. We plan to add tests during reading week to be ready for D3,
   - Smooth navigation
        - Our 

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
